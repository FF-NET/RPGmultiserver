SHORT INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR OCRAM -PLUGINS:

These are generic instructions and all OcRam -plugins are included.
Please just ignore instructions considering plugin(s) you don't use.

1. Get plugins you like from https://ocram-codes.net
   (Recommended to get MZ versions even for MV! - Just see part 11)

2. Install downloaded plugins (https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/blog/using-plugins-in-mz) 
   or for MV (https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-plugins-part1)

3. If time system, weather system, battle core or indicators are used:
   3.1 Get https://ocram-codes.net/download.aspx?folder=misc&file=OcRam_Images&type=zip
   3.2 Unzipit to .\img\ocram -folder in your project

4. Setup / check time system variables and switches (defaults to 1-9 variables and 1-5 switches)

5. Recommended to set or check Weather System "Weather Variable" (defaults to 10)

6. Setup event OcRam_Events bases map (either change map id or reserve map id 1 for event bases)

7. Recommended to set or check OcRam_Lights "Lights KILL switch" (default 6)

8. Default regions 16-22 (reserved for OcRam_Passages for higher/lower passability etc...) 
   and 41-51 (reserved for OcRam_Core passabilities)

9. If Local Coop is used it is VERY IMPORTANT to set "Player in turn variable" 
   (defaults to 0 because it must be manually set (to ensure you know which variable it is))
   NOTE: Do NOT edit value of this variable in-game (plugin will control this variable alone)

10. Fine tune parameters as you like! And see example of default variables and switches after setup.

11. NOTE: If you are using MV and want to use MZ plugins - REMEMBER TO USE RETRO.js!
    11.1. Get it from: https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/retro.135715/
    11.2. For MZ like plugin commands in MV use:

12. Enjoy RPG Making!
